## *Birthday candle problem solution
### Find the highest number in the given array and and count the candles with same height. 
#### The problem here is to get the max from the array and find the count of the maximum heighted candle.
1. The first step:
```javascript   
Math.max(...array)
// This will find the maximum number in array.
```

2. Though we need to find the count of the maximum 
heighted candle.
```JavaScript
for(let i=0;i<array.length;i++)
// Loop over the given array to find the count of the maximum heighted candles.
```
3. I have compared my array values with the maxheight of the candle.

4. If the element in array is equal to maximum height. The counter will be incremented.

5. This process goes on untill the length of the array(candles).

6. At the end will return the count of the maxmum heighted candle.

> ** At the end the code will console the maximum number and its height


### User has an open choice to give the array of their choice.
